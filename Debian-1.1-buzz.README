This is a unofficial image of a Debian 1.1 "buzz" cdrom in jigdo format.

The jigdo files require network access to the Debian archive to reconstruct
the CD-ROM image.

    http://archive.debian.org/debian/dists/buzz/

The "jigdo-lite" command can do the download and reconstruction based either
on a previously mirrored copy of the archive or by directly downloading.

The README at the root of the ISO image describes how to install for QEMU.
